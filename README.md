# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This analysis will help prepare Bobby’s manager and Pewlett_Hackard for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
